# ML Web App v1 — House Prices Prediction (Phase 2: Baseline Model)

## Phase 2 Overview

This phase introduces the **first working model** for the app.  
We’ll start with the **California Housing dataset** (built into Scikit-learn) for simplicity and speed. Later, we’ll expand to the **Kaggle House Prices dataset** for a more realistic, complex challenge.

---

## Objectives

- Load and prepare the **California Housing dataset**.
- Perform basic preprocessing (handle missing values, encode features, scale if needed).
- Train a **baseline regression model** (Linear Regression).
- Save the trained model using `joblib`.
- Evaluate performance with **MAE, RMSE, and R²**.

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- Joblib

---

## Phase 2 Deliverables

- Dataset loaded and cleaned (California Housing).
- Preprocessing pipeline implemented.
- Baseline regression model trained.
- Model saved for reuse.
- Performance metrics recorded.

---

## Next Steps

- **Phase 3**: Build the Streamlit app and integrate the baseline model.
- **Future Expansion**: Switch to **Kaggle House Prices dataset** for richer features and portfolio appeal.
