# ML Web App v1 — House Prices Prediction (Phase 1: Scope & Audience)

## Project Scope

The purpose of this project is to design and deploy a simple machine learning web application that predicts **house prices** based on user-provided attributes.

Phase 1 focuses only on:

- Defining the overall scope of the project.
- Identifying the target audience who will benefit from the app.
- Outlining the intended use cases and deployment environment.

No model training or regression baseline is included at this stage.

## Target Audience

- **Students & Learners**: Those exploring machine learning concepts and wanting to see a practical example of ML deployed as a web app.
- **Junior Engineers & Developers**: Individuals building their portfolios and needing a reference project for end-to-end ML workflow.
- **Educators & Trainers**: Teachers who want a simple, interactive demo to explain regression concepts in ML.
- **General Users**: Anyone curious about how ML can estimate house prices through a user-friendly interface.

## Why This Project?

House prices are a relatable and widely understood problem. Everyone has some intuition about what makes a house expensive or affordable — location, size, number of rooms, etc.  
This makes it an ideal dataset for:

- Demonstrating regression in machine learning.
- Building an app that feels practical and engaging.
- Showcasing how raw data can be transformed into actionable predictions.

---

## Deployment Context

- The app will be built with **Scikit-learn** and **Streamlit**.
- Deployment will be on **Streamlit Cloud (free tier)** for easy public access.

---

## Next Steps

Phase 2 will introduce the **baseline regression model** (Linear Regression) and begin the technical implementation.
